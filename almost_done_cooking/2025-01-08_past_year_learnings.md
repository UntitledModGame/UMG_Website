make hard assumptions earlier. Doesnt matter if it isnt flexible

isolate umg launcher from umg game

dont do premature generalization

more explicit shit, less implicit

IDEOLOGY SUCKS. Always favor practicality

SSOTs are based

Robust/defensive code is great, expecially if contracts are vague

Its ok to copy paste code if it reduces coupling

Use more little helper funcs, instead of adding more abstractions



## Flexibility:
Also IMO, the word "flexibility" is kinda evil.
It sounds nice and rosy, like: "wow, ur system is gonna be so flexibile and great!"
in reality, it usually means that you are prematurely generalizing.
Id much prefer a simple system than a flexible system.
Glue code and boilerplate code is OK
it can always be removed via helpers
